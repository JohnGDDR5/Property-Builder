##Their scripts should be used inside the multifile addon folders when they are installed in blender. You don't replace the __init__.py of your master branch code, leave it. However, do replace the __init__.py of the user addon folder for the addon using their scripts, since it just needs to work inside there

##Maybe, to use it with GitHub and Git, create a separate branch called "Debug" where the addon folder is installed for Blender, just use .gitignore to ignore the compiled python code
##This way, you can have two separate branches, and be able to commit and push your changes to Git with the Debug __init__.py

Make sure to have the setting of Update/Reload Addon when saved, for the Extension to easily reload when the addon is changed.

You must install the Extension for Visual Studio Code by Jacque Luckes:

Use a Linter (For autocomplete for typing faster), https://pypi.org/project/fake-bpy-module-2.82/
Just download the folder for the most recent blender version
